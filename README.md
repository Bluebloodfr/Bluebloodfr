<h2>üöÄ Latest Experience & Internships:</h2>

- <b>2025 (5 months)</b> ‚Äî <b>Software Solutions Technician</b> at Thales Alenia Space, Luxembourg  
  Developed high-res land-cover segmentation (U-Net + EfficientNet-B4, OpenEarthMap/xBD), benchmarked cloud segmentation (OmniCloudMask, Dynamic World U-Net), adapted and trained the TerraMind foundation model for multi-modal Earth Observation, and built explainable/confidence-aware visualization tools.  
  Collaborated with the GeoPulse data team and contributed to rapid prototyping, reproducibility, and operational deployment.

- <b>2024 (4 months)</b> ‚Äî <b>Data Scientist & ML Engineer Intern</b> at Minist√®re des Arm√©es (Marine Nationale), Paris  
  **Main projects:**  
  - **Qlik dashboard for tracking school flows:**  
    Led end-to-end development of a dashboard with Qlik, connecting to Excel data on SharePoint via API, transforming and visualizing flows for the formation office. Worked closely with end-users for iterative improvements and requirements.  
  - **Machine Learning prediction of early resignations:**  
    Built and evaluated models (SVM, CatBoost, PyTorch neural nets) to predict risk of early departure among new recruits, using enriched datasets and SHAP for interpretability. Delivered actionable insights and visualizations for decision-makers.
